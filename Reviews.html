    <h2>What an Amazing Adventure!</h2>
    <p>We had Ele as our guide, and she was fabulous! Funny,personable, and she made you feel safe/comfortable for the snorkel! The suits keep you warm...and they are definitely...tight! I was a little claustrophobic when they had to put tape and an extra collar around my neck (to keep it sealed so water could not leak in), but once we were in the water I forgot all about it! The scenery was unreal! One of the best experiences I've had traveling. It's about a 40-45 minute loop between the plates, then you can get warm with hot chocolate and cookies! :) Well worth it!!</p>
    <h2>Nolan is really fun...</h2>
    <p>Our day started with a pick to golden circle. Guides came exactly on time and met us with happy faces and made us feel very welcome. We bonded immediately !
We did an amazing Golden circle tour, Frazer gave us enough time to see everything we wanted and never rushed us. Whilst driving we heard some cool storied about Iceland, some of them were interesting, some of them were super funny. Ants seemed to be very funny and despite our cultural differences I felt like we were a good team. And that's how I like it.
Then we came to a snorkel spot and I was in Ants.s team. He showed me around and then we had a chat of how our snorkel will go and what we need to do in different situations. It was all clear to me. No doubt I knew I am in good hands! He helped us to get into suits and we were ready!
Silfra is just super beautiful and I just feel so lucky. I also saw 3 fishes. 
We then got some hot chocolate and cookies and apparently you can even have more than 1 (cookie, not chocolate). 
The day went well. 10/10.</p>
